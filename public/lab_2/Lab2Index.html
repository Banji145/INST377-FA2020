        <p id="fourth_paragraph" class="p">
            Dear Dover, Thank you for your recent application to join us at <abbr title="University of Maryland">UMD's</abbr> iSchool to study for your undergraduate in 2020. <br> I will answer your questions one by one, 
            in the following sections.
        </p>

        <h2>Starting dates</h2>

        <p id="fifth_paragraph" class="p">
            We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you <br> could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>First semester: 29 August 2020</li>
            <li>Second semester: 22 January 2021</li>
            <li>Third semester: 2 May 2021</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p id="sixth_paragraph" class="p">
            Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.
        </p>

        <p id="seventh_paragraph" class="p">
            You can find more information about <a href="http://testudo.umd.edu/">important university dates</a> on our website.
        </p>

        <h2>Subjects of study</h2>

        <p id="eigth_paragraph" class="p">
            At the iSchool, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall <br> somewhere in the realm of Information Studies. You seem like a committed researcher, and just <br> the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued <br> by are as follows, in order of priority:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Turning H2O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the <br>  audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 10<sup>3</sup> increasing to 3 × 10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
            <li><abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>

        <p id="ninth_paragraph" class="p">
            So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the <br> research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks.
        </p>

        <h2>Animals of the Extended Perambulation</h2>

        <p id="tenth_paragraph" class="p">
            Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I did study animals. To answer your question, <br> my favourite creatures are as follows, with definitions:
        </p>

        <dl>
            <dt>The Canadian Polar bear</dt>
            <dd>A large predator, very hungry these days. Feeds almost entirely on seal.</dd>
            <dt>The elk</dt>
            <dd>An elk is a horned ungulate found primarily in the mountainous regions of British Columbia. <br> It can be seen from railways, and also frequently visits the Banff centre for the arts.</dd>
            <dt>The red-tailed hawk</dt>
            <dd>An interesting example of historic misinformation: many people believe eagles make the screaming noise <br> associated with them on film. This cry is instead the call of the red-tail.</dd>
        </dl>

            Yours sincerely,
        </p>
